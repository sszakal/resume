# PREVIOUS PROJECTS
# Universal Music Group
- company: Universal Music Group
  duration: 10/2017 &mdash; 06/2019
  summary: "Rights System (greenfield): The rights workspace is primarily used by the legal department to capture rights from legal contracts, 
  artist-level information, royalties and to publish these to downstream systems. I developed numerous components for capturing rights, extended
  the application with new contract types and built migration components for extracting data from the old rights system."

# Red Deer
- company: Red Deer
  duration: 05/2017 &mdash; 08/2017
  summary: "Red Deer System (brownfield): The RD system is a state-of-the-art daily tool for fund managers to make skilful investment decisions, 
  it organises and connects a vast amount data into one unified stream of events. I developed a feature extractor engine for various system 
  documents and events (i.e. broker research) which would be used as a base for a recommender system (machine learning). Also, I have extended 
  the in-memory database query engine with new calculations and queries, refactored the permissions system, enabled single-sign-on authentication 
  using the SAML protocol and worked on developing an accountancy/user usage tracking system that would help investment managers to comply with the MiFID regulations."

# London & Quadrant
- company: London & Quadrant
  duration: 07/2015 &mdash; 03/2017
  summary: "GPIH Project (greenfield): L&Q manages over 70,000 homes across the capital and the South East and is one of London's largest developer of new homes. 
  Part of a business transformation programme I had the task to design bespoke software systems to support the delivery of key services and to digitalize business processes.
  For this assignment, I have used the Agile Scrum development framework and I have implemented a large number of features, to enumerate a few:: business workflows, ranking of 
  potential buyers and tenants based on their income and historical data and incorporated features like auditing, resource-based authorization and access control lists, 
  integrate with 3rd party software systems and adapt the systems to comply with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)."

# British Sky Broadcasting
- company: British Sky Broadcasting
  duration: 03/2014 &mdash; 04/2015
  summary: "Virgin Media VOD Migration Project (brownfield): BSS is a large and complex distributed system that serves over 800 active users and holds all broadcasting scheduling information, 
  serves as a repository for programmes and commercials, manages media slot acquisition, and is responsible for ensuring that transmission schedules are ready to air. BSS is also a key enabler 
  of both products such as Video-On-Demand (VOD), and services such as Sky HD Movies. My first project was to migrate Virgin Media VOD services from a third-party system to an internal platform 
  which required changes at all levels in the software stack.

  Inventory Management Project (greenfield): AdSmart is a revolutionary product for TV advertising, with AdSmart different ads can be shown to different households watching the same TV channel. 
  Households can be selected based on factors such as age, location or lifestyle to build marketing campaigns. I built a business intelligence tool called IMS that allows the AdSmart sales teams 
  to forecast the delivery of impressions (actual views) for new marketing campaigns based on historical data captured by the setup box and by simulating competing campaigns that would overlap 
  with the household segment and period in which the new campaign would be running.

  FAE Project (brownfield): The Flexible Allocation Engine (FAE) is responsible with the prioritisation of AdSmart ads that are passed over to Sky’s TV boxes in the form of hint schedules. 
  I have implement times series forecasting algorithms and fine tune the prioritisation algorithm in such way that it maximises profits by minimising the difference between the campaigns’ target 
  number of impressions and the actual impressions delivered."

# Arvato Bertelsmann
- company: Arvato Bertelsmann
  duration: 11/2012 &mdash; 02/2014
  summary: "BINS Project (greenfield): Developed a scheduling tool for the environmental services department to plan the collection of rubbish bins across the county. I have integrated the application 
  with ArcGIS Map to allow the configuration of routes from a map view and with the public facing council website to provide the bin collection dates for each property/postcode.
  
  MDC 360 Project (greenfield): Built a website for the HR department to conduct employee surveys. The application allowed the HR staff to create custom surveys and send invitations to employees for a 
  360-degree feedback process, while the invitee can send feedback forms to peers and managers."

# Victoria Plumb
- company: Victoria Plumb
  duration: 03/2012 &mdash; 08/2012

  of goods with various package carriers in a way that would minimise the delivery cost and time."

# The University of Hull
- company: The University of Hull
  duration: 06/2011 &mdash; 09/2011
  summary: "Keyforth Project (greenfield): During the course of the dissertation module, which is an industrial placement program done through SEED Software, I have integrated shipping, tracking and 
  proof of delivery functionality into an existing system for major package carriers (UPS, FedEx, DHL), localisation feature to allow the system to support multiple languages, a mechanism to restrict 
  the access for a carrier to a specific user and to provide a flexible design that would easily allow the incorporation of new carriers and functionality into the system."

- company: Continental Automotive VDO
  duration: 06/2011 &mdash; 09/2011
  summary: "Projects/Modules: EEPROM Memory Configurator for Mercedes, Auxiliary Heater module for Porsche Panamera, Text Widget for Porsche. I have engineered software components for ECUs found today 
  in cars produced by Mercedes and Porsche and built cross-compilers to speed up the process of writing software for embedded systems. Part of a research project I’ve also developed a framework to perform 
  runtime measurements on the target microcontroller for integration and performance testing."
